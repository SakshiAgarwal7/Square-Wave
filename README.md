<b> Experiment|    <p align="justify"> <b>1. To construct a square wave with the help of fundamental frequency and its harmonic component.</p>
 
<h5> About the Lab (Objective) :
</h5> <p align="justify">This lab is designed for the students to develope the understanding of signal construction by conductiton of experiments with signals. At the end of the module, students would be able to understand the use of these signals and their properties in the modulation process.</p>
 <h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
<p align="justify">This experiment is for understanding of the electronically construction of square wave with the help of periodic sine wave of fundamental frequency and its harmonic contents. Fourier series is a method to represent any non sinusoidal waveform with a combination of fundamental frequency sine wave and its harmonic components. at the end of module, students will be able to understand to build a square wave up from multiple sine waves at different frequencies.</p>
